## Sieve of Eratosthenes
The program prints all [prime numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_number) up to a given number.
It's an implementation of the famous [Sieve of Eratosthenes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sieve_of_Eratosthenes) algorithm.

NOTE: According to the task's requirements, the code is intent to be *as bad as possible*.
